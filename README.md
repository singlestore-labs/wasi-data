[wasi-data](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-data) is a proposal to add a WASI module for distributed computation. It includes:
 - an [explainer](proposals/wasi-data/Explainer.md), diving into the rationale for this specification
 - the proposed API in WITX form (TODO)

Following the [WASI proposal
process](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/master/docs/Process.md), this repository is a
logical fork of the [main WASI repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI).
